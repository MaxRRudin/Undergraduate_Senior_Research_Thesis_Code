# Undergraduate_Senior_Research_Thesis_Code
This repository includes the code I used to simulate heat transfer in my undergraduate senior research thesis.

The code is currently configured to simulate daytime radiative cooling with simplified emissivity models (section 2.2) and to simulate nighttime radiative cooling with FTIR data from my experimental samples (section 2.3).
